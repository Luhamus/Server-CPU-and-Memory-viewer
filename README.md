## How to use
First, clone the repo and cd into it then:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After than you can run the script with
```bash
./metrics {arg}
```
or, it it gives a module error for some reason,  
```bash
python metrics {arg}
```
Where the arg should be mem for memory or cpu for CPU.
You can check the source code in main.py
